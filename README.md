# new tab thing

this is a new tab project made in a grid/card style with information being displayed, such as the weather using the Open-Meteo API and a local to-do list that stores in your browser's cookies

# installation
if you want to have this same thing you'll first need some browser extension that lets you override your default new tab, there are a bunch so i'd say you pick the one with best rating since they all do more or less the same. And once you have it, you can clone this repository (you'll have to do this to change the weather according to your location for exaample) and host it as a github page, then just replace that link in the override extension and you're done!
